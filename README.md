fact.py: State bogus facts about time
=====================================

Implements the "bullshit generator" found in https://xkcd.com/1930/

Run this to get an interesting "fact" that you can use to impress your friends.
Or add the "-x" option to get the nonsense from the comic's tooltip as well.

I said "your friends."  You do not want to use this on people who dislike you,
and if you try to use it to impress people in a business setting and get found
out, well, you're on your own.  I will not be held responsible.


endorse.py: Produce an endorsement quote
========================================

Picks any of the endorsement quotes from https://xkcd.com/1942/

None of these quotes applies to this project.
